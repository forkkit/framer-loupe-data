## Go futher

Designing with data is a big topic â€“ much bigger than we could fit into the
workshop. To help you take what you've learned further, we've also collected
several projects that show different ways of going further with data in Framer
X.

- [Mapbox](/examples/mapbox)
- [Contentful](/examples/contentful)
- [Sockets](/examples/sockets)
