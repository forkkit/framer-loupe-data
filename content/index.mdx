# Design with Data

Welcome to the companion website for the **Design with Data** workshop at [Framer Loupe 2019](https://www.framer.com/loupe/).

## Extras

Designing with data is a big topic – much bigger than we could fit into the workshop.
You can also download a completed version of the workshop's project **here**, but to help you take what you've learned further, we've also collected several projects that show different ways of going further with data in Framer X.

See the **sidebar** for links to each project.

## Social

Working with code can be frustrating – don't learn alone! To connect with other workshop attendees, discuss the experience, share your projects, or just follow up on your hellos, see this **Spectrum Thread**.
