Follow the steps below to connect this example file above to a Contentful space.

## Sign Up for Contentful

If you already have a Contentful account, you can skip ahead to the section **Create the Example Blog Space**.

1. [Sign up for a free Contentful account](https://www.contentful.com/sign-up/)
2. When prompted "How do you usually work with content?", click **Deploy a website in 3 steps**
3. On the onboarding page, click **Skip** in the upper-right corner

## Create the Example Blog

The _Contentful.framerx_ file is designed to work with Contentful's **Blog Example Space**, so we'll need to create this space.

1. Open the top left menu and select **Create Space**
2. Select the **Free** plan
3. On the next screen, enter a name for your space
4. In the space options, select **Create an example space**
5. In the example tabs, select **Blog**
6. Click **Proceed to Confirmation**
7. Click **Confirm and Create Space**
8. When the space is ready, click **Get started**
9. On the next screen, click **Use the API**

This will open a page that includes your space's **Space ID** and **Access Token**.

## Connect the Framer X project

Now that you have the example space, let's give the Framer X project access to the project's data.

1. Open the _Contentful.framerx_ file
2. In the Code tab, click the _access.ts_ file
3. From the Contentful website, copy your space's **Space ID** to the variable `SPACE_ID`
4. And then copy your space's **Content Delivery API - access token** to the variable `ACCESS_TOKEN`

The result should look something like this:

```ts
const SPACE_ID = "420s9qcxkt8l";
const ACCESS_TOKEN = "r9i8F420zI7mr4_JY_sWT0c30SmtLyqEINWXDFmx5BA";
```

The Framer X project is now connected to your Contentful space! It will pull data from that space each time it reloads. **Preview the Frame named Export to see it in action.**

## Edit your content

Now that your Framer project knows how to get its content from your Contentful space, any changes you make to your content will be reflected in your prototype.

1. In your Contentful space, click the **Content** tab
2. Click on the post named **Automate with Blog Posts**
3. Change the **Title** to something more exciting
4. Change the **Body** to something clever yet accessible
5. Click **Publish changes**

And back in Framer, refresh your prototype to see your changes.

## Learn More

To learn more about using Contentful with Framer X, check out Contentful's [Delivery API Reference](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-delivery-api/). Under the hood, the example project uses the [Contentful JavaScript Delivery SDK](https://contentful.github.io/contentful.js/contentful/7.9.1/) to interface with Contentful.

Good luck!
